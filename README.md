# Plume Pawn

**Plume Pawn** is a decentralized pawnshop application (DApp) built on top of the [Plume Network](https://plumenetwork.xyz). It enables users to pawn tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) using NFTs that are already issued and managed by Plume’s asset tokenization system.

This project utilizes the Plume infrastructure for asset tokenization and implements a custom smart contract to manage the pawn lifecycle — including asset locking, redemption, and liquidation.
